# K40-optoisolator
Simple K40 Optoisolator

Nothing new...
I just wanted to share a simple project of an optoisolator that has the function of interface between any control board with 3.3v in/out with the laser tube power supply of a K40 engraver.
The use of this project is intended for competent people with specific skills.
