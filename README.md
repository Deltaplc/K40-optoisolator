# K40-optoisolator
Simple K40 Optoisolator

Nothing new...
I just wanted to share a simple project of an optoisolator that has the function of interface between any control board with 3.3v in/out with the laser tube power supply of a K40 engraver.
The use of this project is intended for competent people with specific skills.



All parts of this project are covered by an  licenza MIT.
There is no guarantee of operation, and all responsibility will lie with those who replicate and use it
